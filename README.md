Hi 👋 My name is Andrea Rakocija
================================

Software engineer
-----------------

I'm a passionate **Software engineer** from Zagreb, Croatia, with a strong focus on **AI-driven solutions** and **web development**. Currently, I work at Mindsmiths, where I specialize in building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between user needs and cutting-edge technology. 

💼 **My Experience**: 
* **Web Scraping & Automation**: I designed and developed a versatile web scraping system that automatically gathers content to train conversational AI assistants.
* **AI-Powered Tools**: Developed a personalized AI WhatsApp Assistant for students, integrating emotion detection to provide real-time support and elevate user experience.
* **Content Creation Tools**: Built an auto-completion feature to assist users in generating structured content (YAML) more efficiently.
* **Personalized Product Recommendations**: I created a system that integrates scientific data and user feedback to recommend health products tailored to individual needs. 

🔬 **Research & Development**: 
* With a **Master’s in Computer Science** from the University of Zagreb, I’ve explored the intersection of **AI and Natural Language Processing** (NLP). My **thesis** focused on developing a **Natural Language User Interface** for complex simulations, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create intuitive user experiences. Additionally, I tackled the cold-start problem in recommender systems, using **self-supervised learning techniques** and **random walks on graphs** to improve recommendation accuracy. 

💡 **Tech Stack**: 
* Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, Node.js, ReactJS, Ruby on Rails, SQL, Git 

📚 **Certifications**:
* Completed a **Ruby on Rails** course at **Infinum Academy**, where I honed my skills in building scalable APIs and mastering backend development best practices.
